  abstract = {Background: Studies from several countries have reported that children youngest in grade are at higher risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and treatment. Norwegian children start school the year they turn six, making children born in December youngest in their grade. We used data on medication, specialist healthcare diagnoses, and primary healthcare diagnoses from national registers to investigate associations between birth month and ADHD. Methods: All children born in Norway between 1998 and 2006 (N=509,827) were followed from age six until 31 December 2014. We estimated hazard ratios for ADHD medication and diagnoses by birth month in Cox proportional-hazards models. We compared risk among siblings to control for potentially confounding socioeconomic factors, and assessed risk of receiving ADHD medication by birth month while attending different grades in cross-sectional time-series analyses. Results: At end of follow-up, 5.3\% of boys born in October\textendash December had received ADHD medication, compared with 3.7\% of boys born in January\textendash March. Corresponding numbers for girls were 2.2\% and 1.3\%, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for ADHD medication for children born in October\textendash December (reference: January\textendash March) was 1.4 (95\% confidence interval: 1.4\textendash 1.5) for boys and 1.8 (1.7\textendash 2.0) for girls. Analyses with diagnoses as outcome showed consistent results, and analyses restricted to siblings within the study population also supported the findings. Analysis by grade revealed an increased risk for children born late in the year from grade 3 onwards, with most marked differences in higher grades. Conclusions: Children youngest in grade had the highest risk of receiving ADHD treatment. Differences were most marked among older children.},

  abstract = {Background ADHD is diagnosed and treated more often in males than in females. Research on gender differences suggests that girls may be consistently underidentified and underdiagnosed because of differences in the expression of the disorder among boys and girls. One aim of the present study was to assess in a clinical sample of medication na\"ive boys and girls with ADHD, whether there were significant gender x diagnosis interactions in co-existing symptom severity and executive function (EF) impairment. The second aim was to delineate specific symptom ratings and measures of EF that were most important in distinguishing ADHD from healthy controls (HC) of the same gender. Methods Thirty-seven females with ADHD, 43 males with ADHD, 18 HC females and 32 HC males between 8 and 17~years were included. Co-existing symptoms were assessed with self-report scales and parent ratings. EF was assessed with parent ratings of executive skills in everyday situations (BRIEF), and neuropsychological tests. The three measurement domains (co-existing symptoms, BRIEF, neuropsychological EF tests) were investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and random forest classification. Results ANOVAs revealed only one significant diagnosis x gender interaction, with higher rates of self-reported anxiety symptoms in females with ADHD. Random forest classification indicated that co-existing symptom ratings was substantially better in distinguishing subjects with ADHD from HC in females (93\% accuracy) than in males (86\% accuracy). The most important distinguishing variable was self-reported anxiety in females, and parent ratings of rule breaking in males. Parent ratings of EF skills were better in distinguishing subjects with ADHD from HC in males (96\% accuracy) than in females (92\% accuracy). Neuropsychological EF tests had only a modest ability to categorize subjects as ADHD or HC in males (73\% accuracy) and females (79\% accuracy). Conclusions Our findings emphasize the combination of self-report and parent rating scales for the identification of different comorbid symptom expression in boys and girls already diagnosed with ADHD. Self-report scales may increase awareness of internalizing problems particularly salient in females with ADHD.},

This article provides (a) a methodological critique of studies on race bias and gender bias in diagnosis and (b) a narrative review of results from studies with good internal validity. The results suggest that race bias occurs for the diagnosis of conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, comorbid substance abuse and mood disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic affective disorders. Other results suggest that gender bias occurs for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial and histrionic personality disorders. The way that symptoms are expressed (e.g., Black cultural expressions of depression) appears to have a significant effect on diagnoses. It may be possible to decrease bias by expanding the use of (a) mental health screening, (b) self-report measures including some psychological tests, (c) structured interviews, and (d) statistical prediction rules. Finally, evidence exists that (a) the diagnosis of personality disorders should be made using dimensional ratings and (b) training in cultural diversity and debiasing strategies should be provided to mental health professionals.},

We used data from a truly population-based 2005\textendash 2006 survey of all adult twins (20\textendash 47~years) in Sweden to conduct the largest twin study of same-sex sexual behavior attempted so far. We performed biometric modeling with data on any and total number of lifetime same-sex sexual partners, respectively. The analyses were conducted separately by sex. Twin resemblance was moderate for the 3,826 studied monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twin pairs. Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34\textendash.39 of the variance, the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61\textendash.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18\textendash.19 for genetic factors, .16\textendash.17 for shared environmental, and 64\textendash.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.},

The toy's distance and time to the catching place and its velocity were explored as possible timing strategies used by infants to start their hand movement. The aim of the study was to find evidence for a shift in timing strategy and whether there were differences between full-term and preterm infants. In addition, it was investigated how infants continuously guided their hands to the toy and whether this guidance was influenced by their use of timing strategy. The toy approached the infants from the side with different constant velocities and constant accelerations. Results showed that there was little difference between full-term and preterm infants' use of timing strategies. Initially, infants used a distance- or velocity-strategy, possibly causing them to have many unsuccessful catches. After a shift to a time-strategy, infants appeared to increase the number of successful catches and performed longer and more functional tau-couplings between the hand and the toy. One preterm infant did not switch to a time-strategy, and frequently missed the moving toy. The same infant also showed less functional tau-coupling with non-controlled collisions between the hand and the toy. More follow-up research is needed to investigate whether problems with extracting the relevant perceptual information for action could be an early indication of later perceptuo-motor difficulties.},

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder. It can be difficult to discern the symptoms of PTSD and obtain an accurate diagnosis. Different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities focus on different aspects, which may provide complementary information for PTSD discrimination. However, none of the published studies assessed the diagnostic potential of multimodal MRI in identifying individuals with and without PTSD. In the current study, we investigated whether the complementary information conveyed by multimodal MRI scans could be combined to improve PTSD classification performance. Structural and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans were conducted on 17 PTSD patients, 20 trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (TEC) and 20 non-traumatized healthy controls (HC). Gray matter volume (GMV), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and regional homogeneity were extracted as classification features, and in order to integrate the information of structural and functional MRI data, the extracted features were combined by a multi-kernel combination strategy. Then a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to distinguish the subjects at individual level. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. In the pairwise comparison of PTSD, TEC, and HC groups, classification accuracies obtained by the proposed approach were 2.70, 2.50, and 2.71\% higher than the best single feature way, with the accuracies of 89.19, 90.00, and 67.57\% for PTSD vs. HC, TEC vs. HC, and PTSD vs. TEC respectively. The proposed approach could improve PTSD identification at individual level. Additionally, it provides preliminary support to develop the multimodal MRI method as a clinical diagnostic aid.},

  abstract = {Objective. It is important to improve identification accuracy for possible early intervention of major depressive disorder (MDD). Recently, effective connectivity (EC), defined as the directed influence of spatially distant brain regions on each other, has been used to find the dysfunctional organization of brain networks in MDD. However, little is known about the ability of whole-brain resting-state EC features in identification of MDD. Here, we employed EC by whole-brain analysis to perform MDD diagnosis. Approach. In this study, we proposed a high-order EC network capturing high-level relationship among multiple brain regions to discriminate 57 patients with MDD from 60 normal controls (NC). In high-order EC networks and traditional low-order EC networks, we utilized the network properties and connection strength for classification. Meanwhile, the support vector machine (SVM) was employed for model training. Generalization of the results was supported by 10-fold cross-validation. Main results. The classification results showed that the high-order EC network performed better than the low-order EC network in diagnosing MDD, and the integration of these two networks yielded the best classification precision with 95\% accuracy, 98.83\% sensitivity, and 91\% specificity. Furthermore, we found that the abnormal connections of high-order EC in MDD patients involved multiple widely concerned functional subnets, particularly the default mode network and the cerebellar network. Significance. The current study indicates whole-brain EC networks, measured by our high-order method, may be promising biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of MDD, and the complementary between high-order and low-order EC will better guide patients to get early interventions as well as treatments.},

  abstract = {Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder that negatively affects many people's lives worldwide. Developing an automated method to find useful diagnostic biomarkers from brain imaging data would help clinicians to detect MDD in its early stages. Depression is known to be a brain connectivity disorder problem. In this paper, we present a brain connectivity-based machine learning (ML) workflow that utilizes similarity/dissimilarity of spatial cubes in brain MRI images as features for depression detection. The proposed workflow provides a unified framework applicable to both structural MRI images and resting-state functional MRI images. Several cube similarity measures have been explored, including Pearson or Spearman correlations, Minimum Distance Covariance, or inverse of Minimum Distance Covariance. Discriminative features from the cube similarity matrix are chosen with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The extracted features are fed into machine learning classifiers to train MDD prediction models. To address the challenge of data imbalance in MDD detection, oversampling is performed to balance the training data. The proposed workflow is evaluated through experiments on three independent public datasets, all imbalanced, of structural MRI and resting-state fMRI images with depression labels. Experimental results show good performance on all three datasets in terms of prediction accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The use of features from both structured MRI and resting state functional MRI is also investigated.},

  abstract = {Objective Depression in bipolar disorder (BipD) requires a therapeutic approach that is from treating unipolar major depressive disorder (UniD), but to date, no reliable methods could separate these two disorders. The aim of this study was to establish the clinical validity and utility of a non-invasive functional MRI-based method to classify BipD from UniD. Method The degree of connectivity (degree centrality or DC) of every small unit (voxel) with every other unit of the brain was estimated in 22 patients with BipD and 22 age, gender, and depressive severity-matched patients with UniD and 22 healthy controls. Pattern classification analysis was carried out using a support-vector machine (SVM) approach. Results Degree centrality pattern from 8-min resting fMRI discriminated BipD from UniD with an accuracy of 86\% and diagnostic odds ratio of 9.6. DC was reduced in the left insula and increased in bilateral precuneus in BipD when compared to UniD. In this sample with a high degree of uncertainty (50\% prior probability), positive predictive value of the DC test was 79\%. Conclusion Degree centrality maps are potential candidate measures to separate bipolar depression from unipolar depression. Test performance reported here requires further pragmatic evaluation in regular clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Neuroinflammation has been connected to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and neurochemical biomarkers of glial pathology could aid the diagnosis and might support patient stratification and monitoring in clinical trials. Our study aimed to determine the utility of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocyte activation, for the differential diagnosis and monitoring of MDD. Employing Simoa technology we measured levels of GFAP in prospectively collected serum samples from 81 age-matched patients with MDD, schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP), and healthy controls (HC). Highest GFAP levels were determined for MDD. At a cut-off of 130~pg/ml, MDD could be discriminated with 87\% sensitivity from SZ and BP (specificity 70\%) and from HC (specificity 56\%). GFAP levels increased with age (r~=~0.5236, p~=~0.0002) and with MDD severity quantified based on the Montgomery-\AA sberg Depression Rating Scale (r~=~0.4308, p~=~0.0221). Neurofilament light chain serum levels were not different in the diagnostic groups and not associated with GFAP levels (r~=~0.0911, p~=~0.576) pointing to an independence of astrocyte activation on neurodegeneration. Our study provides first evidence that serum GFAP levels could improve the differential diagnosis of MDD and that depression severity could be objectively quantified using serum GFAP levels. Furthermore, serum GFAP might represent a marker to monitor astroglial pathology in the course of MDD.},

Methods We recruited 65 adults with MDD and 68 matched healthy controls, who provided both sociodemographic and clinical information, and completed the HAM-D questionnaire. They were also subject to fNIRS measurement when participating in the verbal fluency task. Using the nested cross validation procedure, the classification performance of each ML model was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The multimodal ML model was able to distinguish between depressed patients and healthy controls with the highest balanced accuracy of 87.98~{$\pm~$}8.84\% (AUC~=~0.92; 95\% CI (0.84\textendash 0.99) when compared with the uni- and bi-modal models. Conclusions Our multimodal ML model demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for MDD. This reinforces the biological and clinical heterogeneity of MDD and highlights the potential of this model to improve MDD diagnosis rates. Furthermore, this model is cost-effective and clinically applicable enough to be established as a robust diagnostic system for MDD based on patients' biosignatures.},

Methods A literature systematic review was undertaken in PubMed and ISI databases with no time limits. Results From the studies included in this review, 10 explored the ``emotional dysregulation model'', showing, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) hypofunction and deficient top-down control system during emotion regulation tasks, despite conflicting techniques and results. Only one study explored the ``conditioned fear overgeneralization theory'', other the ``intolerance of uncertainty model'' and two studies were unspecific (worry induction tasks). Between those, there were 4 studies evaluating pre- and post-treatment with antidepressants or ``mindfulness''. Limitations The studies×³ methodologies differ between one another making it difficult to identify a common finding. Conclusion Emotion dysregulation seems to be an important cognitive dysfunction in GAD patients and fMRI studies suggest that it is related to PFC and ACC hypofunction as well as a deficient cortex\textendash amygdala functional connectivity.},

Although new therapies are needed, lack of knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms underlying TRD hinders development of new therapeutic options. We aimed to identify brain regions in which spontaneous neural activity is not only altered in TRD but also associated with early treatment resistance in MDD. Sixteen patients with TRD, 16 patients with early-phase non-TRD and 26 healthy control (HC) subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. To identify brain region differences in spontaneous neural activity between patients with and without TRD, we assessed fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF). We also calculated correlations between the percent change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17) scores and fALFF values in brain regions with differing activity for patients with and without TRD. Patients with TRD had increased right-thalamic fALFF values compared with patients without TRD. The percent change in HRSD17 scores negatively correlated with fALFF values in patients with non-TRD. In addition, patients with TRD showed increased fALFF values in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and vermis, compared with patients with non-TRD and HC subjects. Our results show that spontaneous activity in the right thalamus correlates with antidepressant treatment response. We also demonstrate that spontaneous activity in the right IFG, IPL and vermis may be specifically implicated in the neural pathophysiology of TRD.},

The R package JATSdecoder supports the application of text mining approaches to scientific reports. Its function get.stats() extracts all reported statistical results from text and recomputes p values for most standard test results. The output can be reduced to results with checkable or computable p values only. In this article, get.stats()'s ability to extract, recompute and check statistical results is compared to that of statcheck, which is an already established tool. A manually coded data set, containing the number of statistically significant results in 49 articles, serves as an initial indicator for get.stats()'s and statcheck's differing detection rates for statistical results. Further 13,531 PDF files by 10 mayor psychological journals, 18,744 XML documents by Frontiers of Psychology and 23,730 articles related to psychological research and published by PLoS One are scanned for statistical results with both algorithms. get.stats() almost replicates the manually extracted number of significant results in 49 PDF articles. get.stats() outperforms the statcheck functions in identifying statistical results in every included journal and input format. Furthermore, the raw results extracted by get.stats() increase statcheck's detection rate. JATSdecoder's function get.stats() is a highly general and reliable tool to extract statistical results from text. It copes with a wide range of textual representations of statistical standard results and recomputes p values for two- and one-sided tests. It facilitates manual and automated checks on consistency and completeness of the reported results within a manuscript.},

After reading summaries, participants answered various questions about their sexual orientation. In Study 1, political moderates and progressives (but not conservatives) who read the continuous manipulation subsequently reported being less exclusively heterosexual, and regardless of political alignment, participants reported less~certainty about their sexual orientation, relative to controls. In Study 2, after exposure to fluid or continuous manipulations heterosexual participants were up to five times more likely than controls to rate themselves as non-exclusively heterosexual. Additionally, those in the continuous condition reported~less certainty about their sexual orientation and were more willing to engage in future same-sex sexual experiences, than those in the control condition.

  abstract = {The American Psychological Association's (APA's) as well as other professional organizations' (e.g., American Psychiatric Association) removal of homosexuality as a mental disorder represented a paradigmatic shift in thinking about exual orientation. Since then, APA (2000) disseminated guidelines for working with lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) clients, and a variety of scholars and researchers alike have advocated affirmative therapeutic interventions with LGB individuals. Despite these efforts, the controversy over treating individuals with LGB orientations using nonaffirmative techniques continues. In this discussion, the limited evidence regarding the efficacy and effects of conversion therapy is surveyed, particularly in the context of empirically supported treatment criteria summarized by Division 12 (clinical psychology) of the APA. Authors then consider the resulting ethical considerations in performing conversion therapy and propose alternative uses of affirmative therapy on the basis of ethical standards defined by APA. Finally, options for treating LGB individuals who are coming to terms with their sexual orientations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Grit, the concept consisting of perseverance and passion towards a desired long-term goal, has been spotlighted as a key psychological resource that is predictive of positive life outcomes including academic achievement, professional success and subjective well-being. Despite its popularity within and outside of academia, much more needs to be researched before we can understand its properties and sociological utility. This dissertation explores the potential location of grit within various sociological discourses, including literature on agency, stratification, and perceived meritocracy. In addition, I explore the relationship between social status, subjective agency, the social valuation of grit, and grit cross-culturally to place grit within proper cultural and structural contexts. In Chapter 2, I propose the psychological notion of grit as a potentially useful variable in sociological analysis and explore its potential for contributing to addressing sociological concerns including human agency and stratification. Grit could work as a ``behavioral engine'' transforming subjective beliefs about agency (e.g., sense of control) to agentic practices that potentially produce better life outcomes. In Chapter 3, using new cross-cultural data collected from South Korea and the United States, I test the current measure of grit, the Grit-S scale, that is developed and predominantly tested in the United States, in two different countries, South Korea and the United States. I find in both countries grit is better understood as the concept consisting of two separate dimensions, perseverance and passion, rather than a global concept. In addition, I find the perseverance facet of grit, but not the passion facet, shows the distinctive utility in explaining subjective well-being beyond subjective agency (i.e., sense of control) in both countries. In Chapter 4, I analyze novel cross-cultural data collected from four nations (France, South Korea, Turkey and the United States) and find an indirect linkage between a person's socioeconomic status and the level of grit through positive associations with the sense of control. That is, people with a higher socioeconomic status tend to hold stronger beliefs about one's agency, and those who are strong believers in one's control over life outcomes, in turn, are more likely to develop grit in these four countries. In Chapter 5, using the same cross-cultural data used in Chapter 3, I investigate the social valuation of grit and whether and how the valuation of grit is associated with individual development of grit in South Korea and the United States. In both countries, grit is valued as a desirable virtue that leads to success in life. However, there is within-society variance: people from lower social statuses tend to value grit as a virtue that leads to success more than those from higher statuses in both country samples. In addition, I find people with a higher sense of control are more likely to value grit as a virtue, and valuing grit is positively associated with the individual development of perseverance in both countries.},

In the past few years, microRNA (miRNA) expression changes in circulating peripheral tissues have been found to be correlative with changes in neuronal tissues from patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. This is a notable quality of a biomolecule to be considered as a biomarker for both prognosis and diagnosis of disease. miRNAs, members of the small non-coding RNA family, have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to epigenetically influence almost every aspect of brain functioning. Empirical evidence suggests that miRNA-associated changes in the brain are often translated into behavioral changes. Current clinical understanding further implicates their role in the management of major psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ). This review aims to critically evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in psychiatric disorders as well as in treatment response.},

  abstract = {Fine-tuning of gene expression is a fundamental requirement for development and function of cells and organs. This requirement is particularly obvious in the nervous system where originally common stem cell populations generate thousands of different neuronal and glial cell types in a temporally and quantitatively perfectly orchestrated manner. Moreover, after their generation, young neurons have to connect with pre-determined target neurons through the establishment of functional synapses, either in their immediate environment or at distance. Lastly, brain function depends not only on static circuitries, but on plastic changes at the synaptic level allowing both, learning and memory. It appears evident that these processes necessitate flexibility and stability at the same time. These two contrasting features can only be achieved by complex molecular networks, superposed levels of control and tight interactions between regulatory mechanisms. Interactions between microRNAs and their target mRNAs fulfill these requirements. Here we review recent literature dealing with the involvement of microRNAs in multiple aspects of brain development and connectivity.},

  abstract = {Childhood environment can have a profound impact on brain structure and function. Epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to play a critical role in adaptive and maladaptive processes by regulating gene expression without changing the genome. Over the past few years, early life stress (ELS) has been established as a major risk factor for major depression and suicidal behavior along with other psychiatric illnesses in adulthood. In recent years, the emergence of small noncoding RNAs as a mega controller of gene expression has gained attention for their role in various disease processes. Among various noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are the most studied and well characterized and have emerged as a major regulator of neural plasticity and higher brain functioning. More recently, although limited in number, studies are focusing on how miRNAs can play a role in the maladaptive processes associated with ELS both at adolescent and adult age and whether these processes are critical in developing depression and suicidal behavior. In this review, we critically evaluate how postnatal ELS relates to abnormalities in miRNA expression and functions from both animal and human literature and draw connections from these findings to depression and suicidal behavior later in life.},

  abstract = {Article Abstract  Objective: To investigate how the combination of clinical and molecular biomarkers can predict worsening of suicidal ideation during antidepressant treatment. Methods: Samples were obtained from 237 patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) treated with either duloxetine or placebo in an 8-week randomized controlled trial. Data were collected between 2007 and 2011. The relationship between treatment-worsening suicidal ideation (TWSI) and a number of clinical variables, as well as peripheral expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), was assessed at baseline. We generated 4 predictive models for TWSI: clinical, mRNA, miRNA, and a combined model comprising the best predictive variables from clinical, mRNA, and miRNA data. Results: Eleven patients (9.8\%) presented with TWSI in the duloxetine group. Among the clinical variables, only baseline depressive severity was found to be mildly predictive of TWSI. Two mRNAs (stathmin 1 [STMN1] and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 9B [PPP1R9B]) and 2 miRNAs (miR-3688 and miR-5695) were identified that were significantly predictive of TWSI when mRNA and miRNA were assessed separately (P = .002, .044, .004, and .005, respectively). The best model included baseline depression severity and expression of STMN1 and miR-5695 and predicted TWSI with area under the curve = 0.94 (P {$<$} .001). Additionally, the combined model did not significantly predict TWSI in the placebo group. Conclusions: This study generated a predictive tool for TWSI that combines both biological and clinical variables. These biological variables can be easily quantified in peripheral tissues, thus rendering them viable targets to be used in both clinical practice and future studies of suicidal behaviors.

  abstract = {Because of the role played by miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation of an array of genes, their impact in neuropsychiatric disease pathophysiology has increasingly been evident. In the present study, we assessed microRNA expression in prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) of a well-characterized cohort of major depressed, bipolar, and schizophrenia subjects (obtained from Stanley Neuropathology Consortium; n = 15 in each group), using high throughput RT-PCR plates. Discrete miRNA alterations were observed in all disorders, as well as in suicide subjects (pooled across diagnostic categories) compared to all non-suicide subjects. The changes in the schizophrenia group were partially similar to those in the bipolar group, but distinct from changes in depression and suicide. Intriguingly, those miRNAs which were down-regulated in the schizophrenia group tended to be synaptically enriched, whereas up-regulated miRNAs tended not to be. To follow this up, we purified synaptosomes from pooled samples of the schizophrenia vs. control groups and subjected them to Illumina deep sequencing. There was a significant loss of small RNA expression in schizophrenia synaptosomes only for certain sequence lengths within the miRNA range. Moreover, 73 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated whereas only one was up-regulated. Strikingly, across all expressed miRNAs in synaptosomes, there was a significant inverse correlation between the fold-change of a given miRNA seen in schizophrenia and its synaptic enrichment ratio observed in controls. Thus, synaptic miRNAs tended to be down-regulated in schizophrenia, and the more highly synaptically enriched miRNAs tended to show greater down-regulation. These findings point to some deficit in miRNA biogenesis, transport, processing or turnover in schizophrenia that is selective for the synaptic compartment. A novel class of ncRNA-derived small RNAs, shown to be strongly induced during an early phase of learning in mouse, is also expressed in man, and at least one representative (SNORD85) was strongly down-regulated in schizophrenia synaptosomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies on the role of microRNAs (miRNA) in anxiety disorders are limited. We aimed to determine the availability of miRNAs as biomarkers in serum and to demonstrate the changes of miRNAs expression in patients with panic disorder (PD).METHODS: Thirty-five patients with PD and 35 healthy controls (HC) were evaluated with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders-I (SCID-I) and Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). In each group miRNA expression analysis was performed in venous blood by the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT\textendash PCR) method for genetic evaluation.RESULTS: Compared with the HC group, eight miRNA expression levels were found different in the PD group. Five of them were upregulated and three of them were downregulated. There was no correlation between the levels of miRNA expression with PDSS total score and PDSS sub-items. However, miR-1297 and miR-4465 expression levels were significantly different between the two groups.LIMITATIONS: There are some limitations in this research. Firstly the number of samples is small. Another limitation of our study is that the presence of medical illness and continuous drug use were not excluded when PD and HC groups were selected.CONCLUSIONS: Our research is the first miRNA expression study in patients with PD which excluded psychotropic use and additional psychiatric disorders. In the PD group, miR-1297 and miR-4465 expression was upregulated than compared to the HC group. miR-1297 and miR-4465 regulate the GABAA gene regions that affect GABAA receptor subtypes that thought to play a role in the aetiology of PD.},

  abstract = {Currently, diagnosis and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) are based on the patients' description of symptoms, mental status examinations, and clinical behavioral observations, which increases the chance of misdiagnosis. There is a serious need to find a practical biomarker for the proper diagnosis of MDD. This study aimed to explore the possibility of microRNA (miRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as specific blood-based biomarker for MDD patients. By using an Affymetrix array that covers 723 human miRNAs, we identified 26 miRNAs with significant changes in expression in PBMCs of MDD patients. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in a larger cohort of 81 MDD patients and 46 healthy controls confirmed that the expression levels of 5 miRNAs (miRNA-26b, miRNA-1972, miRNA-4485, miRNA-4498, and miRNA-4743) were up-regulated. By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the combining area under the ROC curve (AUC) of these five miRNAs was 0.636 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.58\textendash 0.90]. MiRNA target gene prediction and functional annotation analysis showed that there was a significant enrichment in several pathways associated with nervous system and brain functions, supporting the hypothesis that differentially-regulated miRNAs may be involved in mechanism underlying development of MDD. We conclude that altered expression of miRNAs in PMBCs might be involved in multiple stages of MDD pathogenesis, and thus might be able to serve as specific biomarker for diagnosis of MDD.},

However, several studies have shown an association between alterations in microRNA levels and MDD, albeit none of them has taken advantage of machine learning (ML).Supervised and unsupervised ML were applied to blood microRNA expression profiles from a MDD case-control dataset (n = 168) to distinguish between (1) case vs control status, (2) MDD severity levels defined based on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and (3) antidepressant responders vs nonresponders.MDD cases were distinguishable from healthy controls with an area-under-the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.97 on testing data. High- vs low-severity cases were distinguishable with an AUC of 0.63. Unsupervised clustering of patients, before supervised ML analysis of each cluster for MDD severity, improved the performance of the classifiers (AUC of 0.70 for cluster 1 and 0.76 for cluster 2). Antidepressant responders could not be successfully separated from nonresponders, even after patient stratification by unsupervised clustering. However, permutation testing of the top microRNA, identified by the ML model trained to distinguish responders vs nonresponders in each of the 2 clusters, showed an association with antidepressant response. Each of these microRNA markers was only significant when comparing responders vs nonresponders of the corresponding cluster, but not using the heterogeneous unclustered patient set.Supervised and unsupervised ML analysis of microRNA may lead to robust biomarkers for monitoring clinical evolution and for more timely assessment of treatment in MDD patients.},

Serum miRNAs gene expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis; finally, the data represent as the 2\textendash{$\Delta$}Ct followed by further statistical analysis. Results: The serum level of miR-16 was significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) down-regulated (mean: 0.9123 and standard deviation [SD]: 0.06) in compared to normal individuals (mean: 1.6848 and SD: 0.09).

  abstract = {Major depression is a debilitating disease. To date, the development of biomarkers of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a challenge. Recently, alterations in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) from post-mortem brain tissue and peripheral blood have been linked to MDD. The goals of this study were to detect the differential miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of MDD patients. First, the relative expression levels of 179 miRNAs (relative high levels in serum) were analyzed by miRNA PCR Panel in the CSF of MDD patients. Then, the differentially altered miRNAs from CSF were further assessed by qRT-PCR in the serum of the same patients. Finally, the serum differentially altered miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR in the serum of another MDD patients. The CSF-results indicated that 11 miRNAs in MDD patients were significantly higher than these in control subjects, and 5 miRNAs were significantly lower than these in control subjects. The serum-results from the same patients showed that 3 miRNAs (miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, and let-7d-3p) of the 11 miRNAs were significantly higher than these in control subjects, and 1 miRNA (miR-451a) of 5 miRNAs was significantly lower than these in control subjects. The up-regulation of miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, let-7d-3p and down-regulation of miR-451a was further validated in another 32 MDD patients. ROC analysis showed that the area under curve of let-7d-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-221-3p and miR-451a was 0.94, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.94, with specificity of 90.48\%, 95.24\%, 90.48\% and 90.48\%, and sensitivity of 93.75\%, 96.88\%, 90.63\% and 84.85\%, respectively. In addition, target gene prediction found that the altered miRNAs are involved in affecting some important genes and pathway related to MDD. Our results suggested that differentially altered miRNAs in CSF might be involved in MDD, and serum miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, let-7d-3p, and miR-451a might be able to serve as biomarkers for MDD.},

  abstract = {Changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression have been described in major depressive disorder in young and middle-aged adults. However, no study has evaluated miRNA expression in older adults with major depression (or late-life depression [LLD]). Our primary aim was to evaluate the expression of miRNAs in subjects with LLD. We first evaluated the miRNA expression using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and then we validated the miRNAs found in NGS in an independent sample of LLD patients, using RT-qPCR. Drosophila melanogaster model was used to evaluate the impact of changes in miRNA expression on behavior. NGS analysis showed that hsa-miR-184 (log2foldchange\,=\,-4.21, p\,=\,1.2\,\texttimes\,10-03) and hsa-miR-1-3p (log2foldchange\,=\,-3.45, p\,=\,1.3\,\texttimes\,10-02) were significantly downregulated in LLD compared to the control group. RT-qPCR validated the downregulation of hsa-miR-184 (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), but not for the hsa-miR-1-3p. The knockout flies of the ortholog of hsa-miR-184 showed significantly reduced locomotor activity at 21\textendash 24\,d.p.e (p\,=\,0.04) and worse memory retention at 21\textendash 24\,d.p.e (24h post-stimulus, p\,=\,0.02) compared to control flies. Our results demonstrated that subjects with LLD have significant downregulation of hsa-miR-184. Moreover, the knockout of hsa-miR-184 in flies lead to depressive-like behaviors, being more pronounce in older flies.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing interest in searching biomarkers for schizophrenia (SZ) diagnosis, which overcomes the drawbacks inherent with the subjective diagnostic methods. MicroRNA (miRNA) fingerprints have been explored for disease diagnosis. We performed a meta-analysis to examine miRNA diagnostic value for SZ and further validated the meta-analysis results. Using following terms: schizophrenia/SZ, microRNA/miRNA, diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity, we searched databases restricted to English language and reviewed all articles published from January 1990 to October 2016. All extracted data were statistically analyzed and the results were further validated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from patients and healthy controls using RT-qPCR and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A total of 6 studies involving 330 patients and 202 healthy controls were included for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.75-0.86), 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.72-0.88) and 18 (95\% CI: 9-34), respectively; the positive and negative likelihood ratio was 4.3 and 0.24 respectively; the area under the curve in summary ROC was 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.84-0.90). Validation revealed that miR-181b-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-137, miR-346 and miR-34a-5p in PBMNCs had high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the context of schizophrenia. In conclusion, blood-derived miRNAs might be promising biomarkers for SZ diagnosis.},

  abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding endogenous RNA molecules that regulate a wide range of biological processes by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. Thousands of these molecules have been discovered to date, and multiple miRNAs have been shown to coordinately fine-tune cellular processes key to organismal development, homeostasis, neurobiology, immunobiology, and control of infection. The fundamental regulatory role of miRNAs in a variety of biological processes suggests that differential expression of these transcripts may be exploited as a novel source of molecular biomarkers for many different disease pathologies or abnormalities. This has been emphasized by the recent discovery of remarkably stable miRNAs in mammalian biofluids, which may originate from intracellular processes elsewhere in the body. The potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease has mainly been demonstrated for various types of cancer. More recently, however, attention has focused on the use of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of infectious disease; for example, human tuberculosis caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, sepsis caused by multiple infectious agents, and viral hepatitis. Here, we review these developments and discuss prospects and challenges for translating circulating miRNA into novel diagnostics for infectious disease.},

  abstract = {In the past several years, the importance of microRNA (miRNA) in cancer cells has been recognized. Proper control of miRNA expression is essential for maintaining a steady state of the cellular machinery. Recently, it was discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulate in the blood of both healthy and diseased patients, although ribonuclease is present in both plasma and serum. Most of the circulating miRNAs are included in lipid or lipoprotein complexes, such as apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, or exosomes, and are, therefore, highly stable. The existence of circulating miRNAs in the blood of cancer patients has raised the possibility that miRNAs may serve as a novel diagnostic marker. However, the secretory mechanism and biological function, as well as the meaning of the existence of extracellular miRNAs, remain largely unclear. In this review, we summarize the usefulness of circulating miRNA for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for the secretion and incorporation of miRNA into the cells.},

In this study, the potential role of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for AD was investigated. We identified that these miRNAs were down-regulated in the blood serum of probable AD patients. The levels of these miRNAs were also reduced in the serum of AD risk factor models. Although the ability of these miRNAs to conclusively diagnose for AD is currently unknown, our findings suggest a potential use for circulating miRNAs, along with other markers, as non-invasive and relatively inexpensive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD, however, with further research and validation.},

  abstract = {Circulating microRNAs (cimiRNAs) are a class of non-encoding RNAs found in bodily fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tears. CimiRNAs have been implicated as promising biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) disorders because they are actively secreted as messengers and are profoundly involved in fine-tuning of developmental and differentiation processes. Furthermore, they are attractive biomarkers because they are extremely stable, tissue enriched and can be determined in a quantitative manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the current progress regarding the potential value of cimiRNAs as CNS biomarkers. Within this framework five CNS disorders are explored which share a common pathological hallmark namely cognitive impairment. The CNS disorders include Major depression disorder (MDD), Bipolar disorder (BD), Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The similarities and differences between altered cimiRNAs in the different disorders are described. The miR-29 family, miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p are discussed as common dysregulated cimiRNAs found in the CNS disorders. Furthermore, it is shown that the type of bodily fluid used for measuring cimiRNAs is important as inconsistencies in cimiRNAs expression directions are found when comparing CSF, blood cell-free and blood cell-bound samples.},

Activation foci from 12 studies encompassing 475 individuals, i.e., 213 suicide attempters and 262 psychiatric controls were subjected to meta-analytical study using anatomic or activation likelihood estimation (ALE).Result: Activation likelihood estimation revealed structural deficits and functional changes in association with a history of suicidal behavior. Structural findings included reduced volumes of the rectal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and caudate nucleus. Functional differences between study groups included an increased reactivity of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices.Discussion: A history of suicidal behavior appears to be associated with (probably interrelated) structural deficits and functional overactivation in brain areas, which contribute to a decision-making network. The findings suggest that a vulnerability to suicidal behavior can be defined in terms of a reduced motivational control over the intentional behavioral reaction to salient negative stimuli.},

Machine learning analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has shown potential in predicting response for individual patients, which may enable personalized treatment decisions and increase treatment efficacy. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of MRI-guided response prediction in MDD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies using MRI to predict single-subject response to antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. Classification performance was calculated using a bivariate model and expressed as area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, we analyzed differences in classification performance between different interventions and MRI modalities. Meta-analysis of 22 samples including 957 patients showed an overall area under the bivariate summary receiver operating curve of 0.84 (95\% CI 0.81\textendash 0.87), sensitivity of 77\% (95\% CI 71\textendash 82), and specificity of 79\% (95\% CI 73\textendash 84). Although classification performance was higher for electroconvulsive therapy outcome prediction (n\,=\,285, 80\% sensitivity, 83\% specificity) than medication outcome prediction (n\,=\,283, 75\% sensitivity, 72\% specificity), there was no significant difference in classification performance between treatments or MRI modalities. Prediction of treatment response using machine learning analysis of MRI data is promising but should not yet be implemented into clinical practice. Future studies with more generalizable samples and external validation are needed to establish the potential of MRI to realize individualized patient care in MDD.},

  abstract = {A combination of different risk factors, such as genetic, environmental and psychological factors, together with immune system, stress response, brain neuroplasticity and the regulation of neurotransmitters, is thought to lead to the development of major depressive disorder (MDD). A growing number of studies have tried to investigate the underlying mechanisms of MDD by analysing the expression levels of genes involved in such biological processes. These studies have shown that MDD is not just a brain disorder, but also a body disorder, and this is mainly due to the interplay between the periphery and the Central Nervous System (CNS). To this purpose, most of the studies conducted so far have mainly dedicated to the analysis of the gene expression levels using postmortem brain tissue as well as peripheral blood samples of MDD patients. In this paper, we reviewed the current literature on candidate gene expression alterations and the few existing transcriptomics studies in MDD focusing on inflammation, neuroplasticity, neurotransmitters and stress-related genes. Moreover, we focused our attention on studies, which have investigated mRNA levels as biomarkers to predict therapy outcomes. This is important as many patients do not respond to antidepressant medication or could experience adverse side effects, leading to the interruption of treatment. Unfortunately, the right choice of antidepressant for each individual still remains largely a matter of taking an educated guess.},

FMRP knockdown ameliorates the effect of miRNA overexpression on spine morphology. We identified NMDA receptor subunit NR2A as a target of miR-125b and show that NR2A mRNA is specifically associated with FMRP in brain. In hippocampal neurons, NR2A expression is negatively regulated through its 3' UTR by FMRP, miR-125b, and Argonaute 1. Regulation of NR2A 3'UTR by FMRP depends in part on miR-125b. Because NMDA receptor subunit composition profoundly affects synaptic plasticity, these observations have implications for the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, in which plasticity is altered.},

  abstract = {\textbullet{} Our study of predictability of outcomes of psychotherapy used predictions of two kinds: (1) direct predictions by patients, therapists, and clinical observers; and (2) predictive measures derived from the same sources. Seventy-three nonpsychotic patients were treated in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy (mean, 44 sessions). Two thirds of the therapists were residents in psychiatry; one third were more experienced. The two main composite outcome measures, measured at termination, were Raw Gain (residualized) and Rated Benefits, which intercorrelated at .76. Most patients improved and showed a considerable range of benefits. The clinical observers' direct predictions of Rated Benefits were highest (.27, P \&lt;.05). The success of the predictive measures were generally insignificant, and the best of them were in the .2 to .3 range, meaning that only 5\% to 10\% of the outcome variance was predicted. The prognostic Index Interview variables did the best (eg, emotional freedom composite, .30; a crossvalidation for 30 patients was.39 (P \&lt;.05). Neither the therapist measures nor the early psychotherapy session measures predicted significantly. Reanalysis of the similar Chicago Counseling Center study, in our terms, showed a similar low level of prediction success, eg, adequacy of functioning, marital status match, and length of treatment predicted significantly in both studies.},

  abstract = {Calculating and reporting appropriate measures of effect size are becoming standard practice in psychological research. One of the most common scenarios encountered involves the comparison of 2 groups, which includes research designs that are experimental (e.g., random assignment to treatment vs. placebo conditions) and nonexperimental (e.g., testing for gender differences). Familiar measures such as the standardized mean difference (d) or the point-biserial correlation (rpb) characterize the magnitude of the difference between groups, but these effect size measures are sensitive to a number of additional influences. For example, R. E. McGrath and G. J. Meyer (2006) showed that rpb is sensitive to sample base rates, and extending their analysis to situations of unequal variances reveals that d is, too. The probability-based measure A, the nonparametric generalization of what K. O. McGraw and S. P. Wong (1992) called the common language effect size statistic, is insensitive to base rates and more robust to several other factors (e.g., extreme scores, nonlinear transformations). In addition to its excellent generalizability across contexts, A is easy to understand and can be obtained from standard computer output or through simple hand calculations.

  abstract = {Meta-analysis of aggregate data from 14 samples representing 10,143 male subjects shows that homosexuality in human males is predicted by higher numbers of older brothers, but not by higher numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, or younger sisters. The relation between number of older brothers and sexual orientation holds only for males. This phenomenon has therefore been called the fraternal birth order effect. Research on birth order, birth weight, and sexual orientation suggests that the developmental pathway to homosexuality initiated by older brothers operates during prenatal life. Calculations assuming a causal relation between older brothers and sexual orientation have estimated the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to fraternal birth order at 15\% in one study and 29\% in another. The maternal immune hypothesis proposes that the fraternal birth order effect reflects the progressive immunization of some mothers to male-specific antigens by each succeeding male fetus and the increasing effects of such immunization on sexual differentiation of the brain in each succeeding male fetus. There are at least three possible mechanisms by which the mother's immune response could influence the fetus: the transfer of anti-male antibodies across the placenta from the maternal into the fetal compartment, the transfer of maternal cytokines across the placenta, and maternal immune reactions affecting the placenta itself. This hypothesis is consistent with recent studies showing that the quantity of fetal cells that enter the maternal circulation is greater than previously thought, and that the number of male-specific proteins encoded by Y-chromosome genes is greater than previously thought.},

  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen?s ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

Material and Methods. We have conducted a study of 79 male participants who underwent MRI brain scanning. PTSD diagnosis was confirmed in 49 participants. After MRI was taken all scans were software based volume computed and statistically processed. Results. We found that left amygdala is the most significant parameter for distinction between PTSD participants and participants without PTSD. There were no significant differences in volumes of hippocampi and prefrontal cortices. Roc curve method outlined left amygdala AUC\,=\,0.898 (95\% CI\,=\,0.830\textendash 0.967) and right amygdala AUC\,=\,0.882 (95\% CI\,=\,0.810\textendash 0.954) in the group of PTSD participants which makes both variables highly statistically significant. Conclusion. The present investigation revealed significant volume decrease of left amygdala in PTSD patients.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report is to present a systematic and critical review of the more recent literature data about structural abnormalities detected by magnetic ressonance in anxiety disorders. METHOD: A review of the literature in the last five years was conducted by a search of the Medline, Lilacs and SciELO indexing services using the following key words: "anxiety", "panic", "agoraphobia", "social anxiety", "posttraumatic" and "obsessive-compulsive", crossed one by one with "magnetic resonance", "voxel-based", "ROI" and "morphometry". RESULTS: We selected 134 articles and 41 of them were included in our review. Recent studies have shown significant morphological abnormalities in various brain regions of patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls. Despite some apparently contradictory findings, perhaps reflecting the variability and limitations of the methodologies used, certain brain regions appear to be altered in a consistent and relatively specific manner in some anxiety disorders. These include the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex in posttraumatic stress disorder and the orbitofrontal cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The present review indicates that structural neuroimaging has contributed to a better understanding of the neurobiology of anxiety disorders. Further development of neuroimaging techniques, better sample standardization and the integration of data across neuroimaging modalities may extend progress in this area.},

  abstract = {Although differences in clinical characteristics exist between major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), consistent structural brain abnormalities that distinguish the disorders have not been identified.To investigate structural brain changes in MDD using meta-analysis of primary studies; assess the effects of medication, demographic, and clinical variables; and compare the findings with those of a meta-analysis of studies on BD.The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies from January 1, 1980, to February 2, 2010.Two hundred twenty-five studies that used magnetic resonance imaging or x-ray computed tomography to compare brain structure in patients with MDD with that of controls were included in an online database, and 143 that measured common brain structures were selected for meta-analysis.Twenty-five variables, including demographic and clinical data, were extracted from each study, when available. For the meta-analysis, mean structure size and standard deviation were extracted for continuous variables, and the proportion of patients and controls with an abnormality in brain structure was extracted for categorical variables.Compared with the structure of a healthy brain, MDD was associated with lateral ventricle enlargement; larger cerebrospinal fluid volume; and smaller volumes of the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, frontal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex, and gyrus rectus. Patients during depressive episodes had significantly smaller hippocampal volume than patients during remission. Compared with BD patients, those with MDD had reduced rates of deep white matter hyperintensities, increased corpus callosum cross-sectional area, and smaller hippocampus and basal ganglia. Both disorders were associated with increased lateral ventricle volume and increased rates of subcortical gray matter hyperintensities compared with healthy controls.The meta-analyses revealed structural brain abnormalities in MDD that are distinct from those observed in BD. These findings may aid investigators attempting to discriminate mood disorders using structural magnetic resonance imaging data.},

  abstract = {In non-human vertebrate species, sexual differentiation of the brain is primarily driven by androgens such as testosterone organizing the brains of males in a masculine fashion early in life, while the lower levels of androgen in developing females organizes their brains in a feminine fashion. These principles may be relevant to development of sexual orientation in humans, because retrospective markers of prenatal androgen exposure, namely digit ratios and otoacoustic emissions, indicate that lesbians, on average, were exposed to greater prenatal androgen than were straight women. Thus the even greater levels of prenatal androgen exposure experienced by fetal males may explain why the vast majority of them grow up to be attracted to women. However, the same markers indicate no differences between gay and straight men in terms of average prenatal androgen exposure, so the variance in orientation in men cannot be accounted for by variance in prenatal androgen exposure, but may be due to variance in response to prenatal androgens. These data contradict several popular notions about human sexual orientation. Sexual orientation in women is said to be fluid, sometimes implying that only social influences in adulthood are at work, yet the data indicate prenatal influences matter, too. Gay men are widely perceived as under-masculinized, yet the data indicate they are exposed to as much prenatal androgen as straight men. There is growing sentiment to reject ``binary'' conceptions of human sexual orientations, to emphasize instead a spectrum of orientations. Yet the data indicate that human sexual orientation is sufficiently polarized that groups of lesbians, on average, show evidence of greater prenatal androgen exposure than groups of straight women, while groups of gay men have, on average, a greater proportion of brothers among their older siblings than do straight men.},

  abstract = {There is still uncertainty about the relative importance of genes and environments on human sexual orientation. One reason is that previous studies employed self-selected, opportunistic, or small population-based samples. We used data from a truly population-based 2005\textendash 2006 survey of all adult twins (20\textendash 47~years) in Sweden to conduct the largest twin study of same-sex sexual behavior attempted so far. We performed biometric modeling with data on any and total number of lifetime same-sex sexual partners, respectively. The analyses were conducted separately by sex. Twin resemblance was moderate for the 3,826 studied monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twin pairs. Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34\textendash.39 of the variance, the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61\textendash.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18\textendash.19 for genetic factors, .16\textendash.17 for shared environmental, and 64\textendash.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.},

  abstract = {Selection for statistical significance is a well-known factor that distorts the published literature and challenges the cumulative progress in science. Recent replication failures have fueled concerns that many published results are false-positives. Brunner and Schimmack (2020) developed z-curve, a method for estimating the expected replication rate (ERR) \textendash{} the predicted success rate of exact replication studies based on the mean power after selection for significance. This article introduces an extension of this method, z-curve 2.0. The main extension is an estimate of the expected discovery rate (EDR) \textendash{} the estimate of a proportion that the reported statistically significant results constitute from all conducted statistical tests. This information can be used to detect and quantify the amount of selection bias by comparing the EDR to the observed discovery rate (ODR; observed proportion of statistically significant results). In addition, we examined the performance of bootstrapped confidence intervals in simulation studies. Based on these results, we created robust confidence intervals with good coverage across a wide range of scenarios to provide information about the uncertainty in EDR and ERR estimates. We implemented the method in the zcurve R package (Barto\v{s} \& Schimmack, 2020).},

  abstract = {In scientific fields that use significance tests, statistical power is important for successful replications of significant results because it is the long-run success rate in a series of exact replication studies. For any population of significant results, there is a population of power values of the statistical tests on which conclusions are based. We give exact theoretical results showing how selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in a heterogeneous population of significance tests. In a set of large-scale simulation studies, we compare four methods for estimating population mean power of a set of studies selected for significance (a maximum likelihood model, extensions of p-curve and p-uniform, \&amp; z-curve). The p-uniform and p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample sizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well as sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With heterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most accurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the assumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the assumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met. We recommend the use of z-curve to estimate the typical power of significant results, which has implications for the replicability of significant results in psychology journals.},
